Harry Potter	GERALDINE_JOHNSON, GIA_BROWN, GIANNA_LEE, GISELLE_SMITH, GRACE_JOHNSON	Just finished last book. Ron and Hermione are clearly the superior couple, and anyone who says otherwise is wrong!!	False, everyone knows Harry and Hermione are the OTP. Ron can go cry by himself.	Just got done with Deathly Hallows and that was insane. I won't spoil it for the people lagging behind but, mind blown	Really, Deathly Hallows wasn't my favorite of the bunch. I think that the characters like Ron and Hermione were better in earlier books	My favorite was Prisoner of Azkaban because Remus! But Deathly Hallows is cool too ig. Now can we watch the movies?
Bake Off	GUADALUPE_WILLIAMS, HAILEY_BROWN, HALEY_JONES, HANNAH_GARCIA	Here are the blueberry cupcakes I made the other day! Gluten free!	Yum, those look so delicious. I tried baking cupcakes but burned them. Tragic.	In lieu of cupcakes, I made a birthday cake for my mom! Red velvet and cream cheese frosting.	Jealous of that birthday cake, cream cheese frosting is my favorite! Though I personally prefer the cream cheese frosting on carrot cake	Oh you need to share that gluten free cupcake recipe! I'm going on a diet which is not always compatible with this baking club, sadly
Christmas	HAYLEE_MILLER, HAYLEY_DAVIS, HAZEL_RODRIGUEZ, HEAVEN_MARTINEZ, HEIDI_HERNANDEZ, HEIDY_LOPEZ, HELEN_GONZALEZ	It's the most wonderful time of the year! The holiday season!	I went Christmas shopping for my secret santa recipient.. there were lots of holiday sales!	While doing my Secret Santa challenge I accidentally told my little sister that Santa wasn't real. Holiday ruined!	The holiday dessert challenge was really tough. The gingerbread cookies did not come out well.	Christmas is here and that means presents!!
Survivor	IMANI_WILSON, INGRID_ANDERSON, IRENE_THOMAS, IRIS_TAYLOR, ISABEL_MOORE	Finished the immunity challenge! Tribal council is gonna be intense tonight!	I hate when the immunity challenge is physical... I can't do a single push up and it's not fair! I'm afraid I'll get voted out at tribal council now	I wonder who has the immunity idol? I don't trust anyone... bunch of snakes!	Completed the fruit ninja challenge with a score of 457 and feeling pumped for tribal council! Wonder who's gonna get voted off...	Tribal council is always scary, I don't trust anyone and I'm convinced I'm gonna get voted off. Fruit ninja was easy (I got a 213) but not easy enough for me to win apparently, yikes.
Avatar	ISABELA_JACKSON, ISABELLA_MARTIN, ISABELLE_LEE, ISIS_PEREZ, ITZEL_THOMPSON, IZABELLA_WHITE	Okay wow the ending to Book 1 was intense! I love Zuko's character development so far and am excited to see more of his sister	Wow you finished this week's episodes quickly! I'm not gonna spoil anything but you will love Book 2! Lots of fun Zuko and Azula times ahead	I was kind of shook when (spoilers) that girl turned into the moon. And then Aang turned into a fish monster? Spirits are confusing	Lol the moon, her name is Yue okay? And she will be respected! Anyway I agree that you guys are not ready for Book 2, it's gonna be amazing! Glad we finished Book 1 at last	This week's episodes were so fun in my opinion! (Spoilers) I am sad that Yue sacrificed herself because poor Sokka deserves happiness!
Dancers	JACQUELINE_HARRIS, JADA_SANCHEZ, JADE_CLARK, JAELYNN_RAMIREZ, JAMIE_LEWIS, JANELLE_ROBINSON, JASLENE_WALKER, JASMIN_YOUNG, JASMINE_ALLEN, JAYDA_KING	Well I am not good at all at choreography so coming up with my own dance to put on TikTok was hard but... here it is!	I couldn't get TikTok to work for me! Does this mean I fail the challenge? I uploaded a video to youtube, hopefully that counts anyway!	come on, Tiktok isn't that hard once you learn it guys! You can do so much better than that	I do ballet, not hip hop so some of these moves were so hard for me! Not sure I did it right... but tiktok gets to see these moves anyway!!!	Ballet is probably still helpful to learn a choreography and your moves look good! Here is my attempt.
Music Makers	JAYLA_WRIGHT, JAYLAH_SCOTT, JAYLEEN_TORRES	Viola gang rise up! Jk I know we'll never be respected. Anyway, here is my attempt at Shostakovich's viola sonata	I didn't know Shostakovich wrote a viola sonata, that seems...sacreligious. Lol just kidding. I decided to mix it up so instead of classical, here's a fun jazzy piano piece	You can't say a viola sonata is "sacreligious" when you branch out from classical! Smh! Also I'll have you know that Brahms and many others also wrote a viola piece for us!!	I'm trying to learn guitar but I was too lazy to tune it this morning so here's a piece on the recorder instead, hope you like it	While idk if this can ever live up to the recorder,  (simply amazing lol) here's my take on a classical piece
School	JAYLENE_NGUYEN, JAYLIN_HILL, JAYLYN_FLORES, JAZLYN_GREEN, JAZMIN_ADAMS, JAZMINE_NELSON, JENNIFER_BAKER	I hate that we have a group for school.. that doesn't seem very fun! but I guess since classes are starting back up we have no choice :(	Have you guys seen your new class schedule? Anyway, I thought I would make a zoom call group for us to do our study challenge and hold each other accountable	I definitely need someone to hold me accountable thanks for making that group! And no I haven't seen the new class schedule until just now! Five extra minutes? Is that gonna help things?	Yeah I'm not sure what the university was thinking tbh. The new class schedule is unfortunate Anyway I completed the reading challenge, here's the proof:	Okay I know I'm late but I still need to do the study challenge so I'm gonna hop on the zoom call again, I made another link. Someone pls join me!
Language Learners	JESSICA_HALL, JIMENA_RIVERA, JOCELYN_CAMPBELL, JOHANNA_MITCHELL, JOSELYN_CARTER, JULIA_ROBERTS, JULIANA_GOMEZ, JULIANNA_PHILLIPS, JULIET_EVANS, JULIETTE_TURNER, JULISSA_DIAZ, KAELYN_PARKER, KAILEY_CRUZ, KAILYN_EDWARDS, KAITLYN_COLLINS, KAMILA_REYES	Bonjour mes amis! Je m'appelle Jessica! Hopefully you guys understood that, I've been working really hard on my francais	Here is me completing my Duolingo challenge! German is so hard but I'm getting there... anyway proof is attached!	bonjour mes amis. just kidding I have no idea what that means, I'm not a frenchie. here is my duolingo challenge for Spanish this week. adios!	Not gonna lie duolingo makes me sad. It's so hard! Or maybe that's just the german language. Big Oof.	Bonjour mes amis! Definitely not making these up! I attached a screenshot of my duolingo challenge! It was super easy
NaNoWriMo	KAREN_STEWART, KARLA_MORRIS, KATE_MORALES, KATELYN_MURPHY, KATELYNN_COOK, KATHERINE_ROGERS, KATIE_GUTIERREZ	NaNoWriMo is so hard, every year I start with so much motivation and it ends badly - I just started the rough draft of my novel over for the third time - yikes	My novel is still in the rough draft phase too, don't worry. I spent a long time coming up with characters and backstories. Not enough time actually writing	Dude characters and backstories are my favorite part of writing! maybe that's the issue. I take so long thinking about my world and less time writing about it.	Just because you want to write a book, doesn’t mean it’s easy to find the time to actually do it! That's why NaNoWriMo and this club is so helpful to me	Personally I dislike characters and backstories but I think that makes me the odd one out, I prefer writing about themes
Makeup	KAYLA_ORTIZ, KAYLEE_MORGAN, KAYLEEN_COOPER	Here is this week's look! It involved a lot of playing around with the eyeshadow to get the effect right, hope you guys like it	This week's look I chose to go for a more goth theme which is out of my comfort zone but I really like how the purple lipstick turned out!	I am obsessed with glittery eyeshadow so for this week's look I used eyeshadow all over my face lol!	Okay I didn't have time to do the challenge so I'll just show you guys this look I did a couple weeks ago but I really like the glowy dewy look	Wow, that dewy look is really gorg! Personally I think it makes me look oily but it looks great on your skin. I am obsessed!
Netflix	KAYLEIGH_PETERSON, KAYLIE_BAILEY, KAYLIN_REED, KEILY_KELLY, KELLY_HOWARD, KEYLA_RAMOS, KHLOE_KIM, KIARA_COX, KIMBERLY_WARD	Just binged the office for the tenth time. Not exaggerating. It's just a good show! This is my 3rd time getting through it in quarantine	the office is like comforting to me, it's good to have in the background but I wanna branch out now. I just started a bunch of Netflix documentaries	I started Pose this week which is a Netflix originals and I really enjoy it! Netflix originals have been getting better quality imo	Idk I don't like how they market the Netflix original in my opinion. I'd much rather have actual reviews and ratings back, not their matching system	the office is a classic, but I can't help but feel like people who watch it that often are missing out on so much! there's a great world of cinema beyond the office you know
Terry Bros	KRYSTAL_RICHARDSON, KYLEE_WATSON, KYLIE_BROOKS, LAILA_CHAVEZ	Bro, I added your mom on my LinkedIn profile and now I have like 300 connections	No way bro this excel challenge was really difficult. Pivot tables are hard!	The LinkedIn networking challenge was pretty hard bro, I only found 10 consulting people	All I do is consulting case studies and excel pivot tables bro I'm so sad	I've been working on my Excel skills and they're really looking good, I'm a consulting god now
Fitness Business	LAURA_WOOD, LAUREN_JAMES	I took 10000 steps for the first time since the quarantine started. Yay! But also yikes? Otherwise my step count averages like less than 1k	My step count probably averages like 50 so that's very impressive. I am going to get a fitbit so it will track my activity better than a phone.	For the walking challenge I thought it was too boring so I ran instead. I did 6 miles. Pretty proud of myself!	Running 6 miles is crazy! I'm very unfit but gettiing better, but I still can barely run a single mile in less than 12 mins. Oof. I've been doing some bodyweight at home but should prob do cardio	Cardio is good but I prefer strength training. It seems more fun! But I definitely need cardio, I can't run either. It's not great
Disney Pals	LAYLA_BENNETT, LEA_GRAY, LEAH_MENDOZA, LEILA_RUIZ, LEILANI_HUGHES, LESLEY_PRICE	Did you guys see that they put Hamilton on disney plus? The only good thing to come out of 2020	disney plus really do be coming in clutch for us, I gotta say. I am enjoying going through the classics like snow white, robin hood, and cinderella.	disney world has opened again. big yikes. they are probably gonna have an outbreak. anyway for the challenge I watched cinderella	aw I love cinderella, what a classic! and yeah disney world should just shut down, I don't know what they're thinking to be honest.	great news about Hamilton! glad I paid for disney plus. Actually I'm stealing it from my sister but don't tell her that. not a fan of cinderella though, one of the more boring princesses
